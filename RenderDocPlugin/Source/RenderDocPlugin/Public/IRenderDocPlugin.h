/**
* The RenderDoc plugin has been redesigned as an input plugin. Regular plugins built upon
* IModuleInterface lack the ability of ticking, while IInputDeviceModule instantiates and
* manages an IInputDevice object that is capable of ticking.
*
* By responding to tick events, the RenderDoc plugin is able to intercept the entire frame
* activity, including Editor (Slate) UI rendering and SceneCapture updates; older versions
* of the RenderDoc plugin were limited to capturing particular viewports only.
*
* This public interface wrapper appears to be mandatory for input device plugins/modules.
* Without this public wrapper, the input device (IInputDevice) associated with the plugin
* will not be instantiated during engine/application startup time.
